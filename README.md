# MazeWalker-Prototype
initial commit

## Lab Karel 5.9

This lab solves problem set 5, problem 9, page 132.

You will build a maze solving robot in this lab.  To do this, you will first implement a robot that can utilize a common brute force maze solving algorithm -- following the right hand wall.

## Specification



##Instructions
###Phase 1
1.  Create a new interface called MazeSolver with a public single method "public void solveMaze()"
2.  Create a new robot subclass called MazeWalker, that (trivially) complies with MazeSolver, and also remember to implement a standard 4-parameter constructor.
3.  In MazeWalker, implement a method "public void followWallRight()" that given the "Possible Situations", leaves the robots in the positions indicated in "Their Respective Movements"
